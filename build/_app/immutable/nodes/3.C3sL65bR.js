		through the basics of Cabin and how to get started with the language, all the way from your
		first "Hello world" program to complex programs with external libraries.</p> <h2>What is Cabin?</h2> <p>Cabin is a programming language designed to be <b>safe</b>, <b>simple</b>, and <b>speedy</b>. To
		be specific, it's a memory-safe, statically typed, compiled, multi-paradigm programming
		language.</p> <p>Cabin has a number of features that makes it unique, but most notably is it's treatment of <i>compile-time evaluation</i>. Cabin allows arbitrary expressions to be evaluated at
		compile-time, similar to other modern languages such as Zig and Jai. However, Cabin takes this a
		step further by <i>always</i> evaluating expressions at compile-time by <i>default</i> if it is able
		to be. This leads to a superb developer experience where complex bugs can be caught at compile-time
		and displayed in real-time in an editor.</p> <h2>Navigating These Docs</h2> <p>On the left side of these docs you'll see the sidebar with the book's contents. You may notice
		that it's quite short, and that's because Cabin is quite simple. You could very easily learn the
		entire language in a day.</p> <h2>Final Remarks</h2> <p>Good luck, and stay cozy!</p>`,1);function d(e){n(e,{page:"Introduction",children:(a,l)=>{var t=r();s(16),o(a,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{d as component};
