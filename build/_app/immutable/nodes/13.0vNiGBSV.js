This is a statement just like any other, and statements end with a semicolon.</p> <p>Also, Cabin has no concept of "truthy" or "falsy"; <code>if</code> conditions expect a <code>Boolean</code> and only a <code>Boolean</code> .</p> <h2 id="otherwise">Otherwise Blocks</h2> <p>An <code>if</code> expression can have an accompanying <code>otherwise</code> block, which runs if the condition is <code>false</code> :</p> <!> <p><code>otherwise</code> may also be followed by another <code>if</code> condition:</p> <!> <h2 id="expressions">Ifs as expressions</h2> <p><code>if</code> can actually be used as an expression, similar to what you might find in a more functional language.

For now, just understand that the value after <code>it is</code> is what gets assigned to <code>last_name</code> , depending on whether the condition is true.</p> <p>Note that when using an <code>if</code> as an expression like this, it <i>must</i> have an <code>otherwise</code> block without a condition. It may also contain conditional <code>otherwise if</code> blocks in between, but it needs to have a final catch-all <code>otherwise</code> block.</p>`,1);function I(d){p(n=>{r.title="If Expressions â€¢ Cabin Docs"}),u(d,{page:"If Expressions",children:(n,w)=>{var a=y(),i=e(l(a),4);o(i,{language:"cabin",code:`
