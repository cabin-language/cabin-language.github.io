</svelte:head>

<Documentation page="Control Flow">
	<h1>Control Flow</h1>

	<p>
		Control flow in Cabin is mostly handled through labels and <code>is</code> statements. An
		<code>is</code> statement is like a <code>goto</code> that jumps to a label.
	</p>

	<h2 id="labels">Labels &amp; <code>is</code> Statements</h2>

	<p>
		When you assign bind a name with a <code>let</code> declaration, the value of the binding is labelled
		with the name. This might sound a little confusing, but it's super straightforward once you see it:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
let length_in_cm = if units == "inches" &lbrace;
    length_in_cm is length * 2.54;
&rbrace; otherwise &lbrace;
    length_in_cm is length;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p>
		In this example, when we do <code>length_in_cm is</code>, that interrupts the current control
		flow to "goto" the name binding, assigning the value of the <code>is</code> statement.
	</p>

	<h2 id="reserved-labels">Reserved Labels</h2>

	<p>
		For convenience, Cabin provides a number of reserved labels. These aren't necessary at all, but
		they're often helpful.
	</p>

	<h3 id="it">The <code>it</code> Label</h3>

	<p>
		The first reserved label is one we've see before: <code>it</code>. <code>it</code> will break to
		the "most inner binding". It will traverse up the scope tree until the result of the current expression
		is being used for a binding. Consider this example from before:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
let danny = foreach person in people &lbrace;
    if person.first_name == "danny" &lbrace;
        it is danny;
    &rbrace;;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p>
		So <code>it</code> works its way up the scope tree. In this case, it first checks the
		<code>if</code> expression. Since the result of the <code>if</code> expression isn't being bound
		to anything, it goes up one more level to the <code>foreach</code> loop. The
		<code>foreach</code> loop <i>is</i> being bound to a name (<code>danny</code>), so
		<code>it</code> is going to break to this level.
	</p>

	<h3 id="return">The <code>return</code> Label</h3>

	<p>
		The next reserved label is <code>return</code>. That's right, in Cabin, <code>return</code>
		isn't a keyword with it's own syntax; It's just a built-in identifier. <code>return</code>
		refers to the current (innermost) action. We haven't talked about <code>actions</code> yet, but if
		you're familiar with other languages, they're like functions. Here's an example of an early return:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
let divide = action(a: Number, b: Number) &lbrace;
    if b == 0 &lbrace;
        return is 0;
    &rbrace;

    return is a / b;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p> This is exactly equivalent to doing this: </p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
let divide = action(a: Number, b: Number) &lbrace;
    if b == 0 &lbrace;
        divide is 0;
    &rbrace;

    divide is a / b;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p><code>return</code> always just expands to the current (innermost) action name.</p>

	<h3 id="loop">The <code>loop</code> Label</h3>

	<p>
		There is a built-in label called <code>loop</code>. <code>loop</code> is similar to
		<code>return</code>, but it refers to the innermost loop instead. So, our previous example could
		also be written like this:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
let danny = foreach person in people &lbrace;
    if person.first_name == "danny" &lbrace;
        loop is danny;
    &rbrace;;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p>
		However, this is not the most idiomatic way to use <code>loop</code>; This example is better fit
		for <code>it</code> or just <code>danny</code>; Using <code>loop</code> here actually gives a
		warning. Instead, <code>loop</code> is useful when we aren't binding the result of the loop:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
foreach person in people &lbrace;
    print(person.first_name);
    if person.first_name == "danny" &lbrace;
        loop is nothing;
    &rbrace;;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p>
		In this case, we want to break out of the loop as soon as we find a person with the first name <code
			>"danny"</code
		>.</p
	>

	<h3 id="done">The <code>done</code> Value</h3>

	<p
		>This is <i>almost</i> idiomatic, except we don't like to use <code>nothing</code> for this use
		case, because it's a little confusing that we are just trying to break out of the loop, and
		using <code>nothing</code> for this will also give a warning. Instead, we have a built-in alias
		for <code>nothing</code> called <code>done</code> that's designed for this exact use case:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
foreach person in people &lbrace;
    print(person.first_name);
    if person.first_name == "danny" &lbrace;
        loop is done;
    &rbrace;;
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>

	<p>
		This provides much more clear intent, and finally we have no warnings; This is the idiomatic way
		to break out of a loop that isn't binding a value. By the way, using <code>done</code> instead
		of <code>nothing</code> in any other situation will result in a warning.
	</p>

	<h3 id="iteration">The <code>iteration</code> Label</h3>

	<p>
		Finally, the <code>iteration</code> label refers to the end of the current loop body, i.e.,
		using <code>iteration is done;</code> is equivalent to a <code>continue</code> in most languages:
	</p>

	<Snippet>
		<pre>
foreach person in people &lbrace;

    // skip danny and continue
    if person.first_name == "danny" &lbrace;
        iteration is done;
    &rbrace;;

    print(person.first_name);
&rbrace;;
</pre>
	</Snippet>
