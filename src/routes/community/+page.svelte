	<h1>Community</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to the Cabin community! By being here, you're already one of us! We're called campers,
		and we're delighted to have you. Currently, the Cabin community is very small, but we hope to
		grow into a large and diverse group.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cabin has communities in a few places. Most general discussion and community building happens in
		the Cabin Discord server.
	</p>

		The Cabin Discord server is the best place for interacting with the community! Feel free to stop
		by and chat! The Discord server has channels for help with the language, general discussion,
		suggestions, updates, and more. It's a welcoming and friendly place for all campers!
